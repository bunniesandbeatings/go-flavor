# Structure 101 Golang flavor

This is a Golang flavor for the [Structure 101](https://structure101.com/) static analysis and architectural decision making tool. 

Note: If you're wondering where the code for the runner lives, it's [here](https://github.com/bunniesandbeatings/go-flavor-parser).

## Why?

I used Structure 101 in the past, on Actionscript and Java projects. It was fantastic, really helped me recognize flaws in my dependency tree. Many people miss the value of a well structured, cycle-free dependency tree. For me, it's central to producing code that is easy to reason about.

For many years, I've been primarily a Ruby developer. Unfortunately, Ruby's dynamicism does not lend itself well to static analysis, and I've aborted my attempt to produce a Ruby flavor for Structure 101.  

I'm also developing in Go more and more, not so much by choice but because it fits the needs of products I work with. So despite my misgivings about the expressiveness of Go, I still want to have great tools for working with it. This Structure 101 flavor is one of them.

## Currently

Not much here yet. A simple flavor you have to download, build the binary dependency for, and put in your struct101g folder. It only reads package level dependencies from your app at the moment. 

## Plans

  0. Runner binaries for osx, linux and windows
  0. Tests! Currently this code is a [Spike](http://agiledictionary.com/209/spike/). I'm a TDD guy, but with severe limitations on my time and weak Golang skills, I'm just hacking to prove value. I want to throw my code out and rewrite it with tests driving out the design.
  0. CI, probably on CircleCI.
  0. Node types:
    0. Package (Done!)
      0. Constant
      0. Variable
      0. Function
    0. Type (struct/interface)
      0. Public field
      0. Function
  0. Dependency types:
    0. Import (Done!)
    0. Variable/Const type definition
    0. Field type Definition
    0. Parameter type definition
    0. Return type definition
    0. Function calls
    0. Casts

## Installation
Currently this is only tested on OSX. It should work on any *nix with a bash shell.

0. Install go and make sure your GOPATH is set up
0. Download and build

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/bunniesandbeatings/go-flavor
  cd go-flavor
  ./scripts/build
  ```
  
0. Symlink into Struct101g (if you cant find the struct101g folder, run struct101g first and install one of the other flavors)

  ```shell
  ln -s `pwd` $HOME/structure101g/flavors/com.bunniesandbeatings.go-flavor_0.0.1
  ```

0. You must restart Structure 101g, it should have a new Project type under 'New Project' for the Go flavor.

## Usage 

0. In Structure 101g, create a new project
0. Select the "com.bunniesandbeatings.go-flavor" project type
0. click Next
0. For '$GOPATH', enter your gopath. Unfortunately Structure 101g doesn't run the flavor's runner using your shell environment.
0. For 'Package Definition', use a package ref as described by ```go help packages```
  0. For example ```github.com/bunniesandbeatings/go-flavor-parser/...```
